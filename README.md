Dgraph's goal is to provide [Google](https://www.google.com) production level scale and throughput,
with low enough latency to be serving real time user queries, over terabytes of structured data.
Dgraph supports [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) as query language, and responds in [JSON](http://www.json.org/).

Your feedback is welcome. Feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues)
when you encounter bugs and to direct the development of Dgraph.

There's an instance of Dgraph running at http://dgraph.xyz, that you can query without installing Dgraph.
This instance contains 21M facts from [Freebase Film Data](http://www.freebase.com/film).
`curl dgraph.xyz/query -XPOST -d '{}'`


## Quick Testing

### Single instance via Docker
There's a docker image that you can readily use for playing with Dgraph.
```
$ docker pull dgraph/dgraph:latest
# Setting a `somedir` volume on the host will persist your data.
$ docker run -t -i -v /somedir:/dgraph -p 80:8080 dgraph/dgraph:latest
```

Now that you're within the Docker instance, you can start the server.
```
$ mkdir /dgraph/m # Ensure mutations directory exists.
$ dgraph --mutations /dgraph/m --postings /dgraph/p --uids /dgraph/u
```
There are some more options that you can change. Run `dgraph --help` to look at them.

Run some mutations and query the server, like so:
```
# Make Alice follow Bob, and give them names.
$ curl localhost:80/query -X POST -d $'mutation { set {<alice> <follows> <bob> . \n <alice> <name> "Alice" . \n <bob> <name> "Bob" . }}'

# Now run a query to find all the people Alice follows 2 levels deep. The query would only result in 1 connection, Alice to Bob.
$ curl localhost:80/query -X POST -d '{me(_xid_: alice) { name _xid_ follows { name _xid_ follows {name _xid_ } } }}'

# Make Bob follow Greg.
$ curl localhost:80/query -X POST -d $'mutation { set {<bob> <follows> <greg> . \n <greg> <name> "Greg" .}}'

# The same query as above now would now show 2 connections, one from Alice to Bob, another from Bob to Greg.
$ curl localhost:80/query -X POST -d '{me(_xid_: alice) { name _xid_ follows { name _xid_ follows {name _xid_ } } }}'
```
Note how we can retrieve XIDs by using `_xid_` identifier.

### Multiple distributed instances
We have loaded 21M RDFs from Freebase Films data along with their names into 3 shards.
They're located in dgraph-io/benchmarks repository.
To use it, install [Git LFS first](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
I've found the Linux download to be the easiest way to install.
Note that this repository has over 1GB worth of data.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dgraph-io/benchmarks.git
$ cd benchmarks/rocks
$ tar -xzvf uids.async.tar.gz -C $DIR
$ tar -xzvf postings.tar.gz -C $DIR
# You should now see directories p0, p1, p2 and uasync.final. The last directory name is unfortunate, but made sense at the time.
```
For quick testing, you can bring up 3 different processes of Dgraph. You can of course, also set this up across multiple servers.
```
go build . && ./dgraph --instanceIdx 0 --mutations $DIR/m0 --port 8080 --postings $DIR/p0 --workers ":12345,:12346,:12347" --uids $DIR/uasync.final --workerport ":12345" &
go build . && ./dgraph --instanceIdx 1 --mutations $DIR/m1 --port 8082 --postings $DIR/p1 --workers ":12345,:12346,:12347" --workerport ":12346" &
go build . && ./dgraph --instanceIdx 2 --mutations $DIR/m2 --port 8084 --postings $DIR/p2 --workers ":12345,:12346,:12347" --workerport ":12347" &
```
Now you can run any of the queries mentioned in [Test Queries](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/wiki/Test-Queries).
You can hit any of the 3 processes, they'll produce the same results.

`curl localhost:8080/query -XPOST -d '{}'`

## Usage

### Distributed Bulk Data Loading
Let's load up data first. If you have RDF data, you can use that.
Or, there's [Freebase film rdf data here](https://github.com/dgraph-io/benchmarks).

Bulk data loading happens in 2 passes.

#### First Pass: UID Assignment
We first find all the entities in the data, and allocate UIDs for them.
You can run this either as a single instance, or over multiple instances.

Here we set number of instances to 2.
```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/dgraph/dgraphassigner

# Run instance 0.
$ go build . && ./dgraphassigner --numInstances 2 --instanceIdx 0 --rdfgzips $BENCHMARK_REPO/data/rdf-films.gz,$BENCHMARK_REPO/data/names.gz --uids ~/dgraph/uids/u0

# And either later, or on another server, run instance 1.
$ go build . && ./dgraphassigner --numInstances 2 --instanceIdx 1 --rdfgzips $BENCHMARK_REPO/data/rdf-films.gz,$BENCHMARK_REPO/data/names.gz --uids ~/dgraph/uids/u1
```

Once the shards are generated, you need to merge them before the second pass. If you ran this as a single instance, merging isn't required.
```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/tools/merge
$ go build . && ./merge --stores ~/dgraph/uids --dest ~/dgraph/uasync.final
```
The above command would iterate over all the directories in `~/dgraph/uids`, and merge their data into one `~/dgraph/uasync.final`.
Note that this merge step is important if you're generating multiple uid intances, because all the loader instances need to have access to global uids list.

#### Second Pass: Data Loader
Now that we have assigned UIDs for all the entities, the data is ready to be loaded.

Let's do this step with 3 instances.
```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/dgraph/dgraphloader
$ go build . && ./dgraphloader --numInstances 3 --instanceIdx 0 --rdfgzips $BENCHMARK_REPO/data/names.gz,$BENCHMARK_REPO/data/rdf-films.gz --uids ~/dgraph/uasync.final --postings ~/dgraph/p0
$ go build . && ./dgraphloader --numInstances 3 --instanceIdx 1 --rdfgzips $BENCHMARK_REPO/data/names.gz,$BENCHMARK_REPO/data/rdf-films.gz --uids ~/dgraph/uasync.final --postings ~/dgraph/p1
$ go build . && ./dgraphloader --numInstances 3 --instanceIdx 2 --rdfgzips $BENCHMARK_REPO/data/names.gz,$BENCHMARK_REPO/data/rdf-films.gz --uids ~/dgraph/uasync.final --postings ~/dgraph/p2
```
You can run these over multiple machines, or just one after another.

### Server
Now that the data is loaded, you can run the Dgraph servers. To serve the 3 shards above, you can follow the [same steps as here](#multiple-distributed-instances).
Now you can run GraphQL queries over freebase film data like so:
```
curl localhost:8080/query -XPOST -d '{
	me(_xid_: m.06pj8) {
		type.object.name.en
		film.director.film {
			type.object.name.en
			film.film.starring {
				film.performance.character {
					type.object.name.en
				}
				film.performance.actor {
					type.object.name.en
					film.director.film {
						type.object.name.en
					}
				}
			}
			film.film.initial_release_date
			film.film.country
			film.film.genre {
				type.object.name.en
			}
		}
	}
}' > output.json
```
This query would find all movies directed by Steven Spielberg, their names, initial release dates, countries, genres, and the cast of these movies, i.e. characteres and actors playing those characters; and all the movies directed by these actors, if any.

The support for GraphQL is [very limited right now](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/1).
You can conveniently browse [Freebase film schema here](http://www.freebase.com/film/film?schema=&lang=en).
There're also some schema pointers in [README](https://github.com/dgraph-io/benchmarks/blob/master/data/README.md).
